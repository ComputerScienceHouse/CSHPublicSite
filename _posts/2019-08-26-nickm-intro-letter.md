Hey there!

If you’ve made it this far, you’re probably thinking about becoming a member.
That’s great! We need curious and motivated people like you. I want to take a
minute and walk you through our intro process so that you know what to expect;
there’s a handful of steps involved and I want you to have a clear idea of
what you’re getting yourself into.

The majority of the intro process takes place during the first 10 weeks of
school. The first 2 weeks are what we call “packet season”. Packet season is
all about meeting people - we want CSH to be a tight-knit community, so we
believe that every member should meet every other member. A Packet is a list
of the names of all active CSH members, and one is given to every intro member.
Your job as an incoming CSHer is to seek out and meet as many active members
as you can. This isn’t as easy as hide-and-seek. Once you find an upperclassman,
you have to put in an effort to genuinely get to know them! Ask them about what
their interests are, what projects they’ve done, or how their co-op experiences
have gone. Active members will sign your packet if they think you’d make a good
member of CSH, which is usually the case if you show that you’re passionate and
interested in what you do. After packet season is over, we’ll count up all of
the signatures you’ve collected. If you get a passing percentage of signatures,
congratulations! You’ll receive a CSH account and gain access to all of our
house computer services. If not, there’s still hope! The packet is just one
component of your 10-week evaluation.

We have a handful of other objectives for you during the 10-week intro process.
These requirements are intended to introduce you to our house culture and
traditions, and are things that active members continue to do throughout their
entire membership. One of the first things we ask you to do is attend some of
our directorship meetings. Each of our 7 directors hosts a weekly meeting where
they discuss ongoing projects, upcoming events, or other news that falls in
their domain. Intro members are expected to attend any 10 directorship meetings
during the 10-week evaluation period, preferably at least one a week. Another
cornerstone of CSH culture is the presentation of technical seminars! Technical
seminars early in the year are usually given by upperclassmen and tend to focus
on introducing you to the world of computer science. Common early-year topics
include setting up basic coding tools, intro to Linux operating systems,
version control for code, and more. Upperclassmen volunteer a lot of time to
prepare seminars, so we ask every intro member to attend at least 2 of them
during their 10 weeks. Plus, this is a special-interest house for computer
science, you probably want to attend as many seminars as you can.

Our last but most important requirement is for you to attend all of our house
meetings. House meetings happen every Sunday at 7:15pm, and are where the
directors summarize house news and events for the past week and upcoming weeks.
This meeting is required because it’s the one time we have a chance to address
all of house together, and is when we make large decisions as a group. Though
we require you to attend every house meeting, we also understand that life
happens. If you can’t make it because you’re sick or out of town, just let
our Evaluations director know and they’ll write a note about your absence.

At the end of the 10-week intro process, all of the upperclassmen gather
together to vote on intro members. During this meeting, we look at the big
picture of how well you’ve met the requirements and who you are as a person.
Did you attend at least 10 directorship meetings? Did you get a good score on
packet? Are you a curious and engaged member? Are you friendly and
light-hearted? Remember, we want CSH to be a welcoming and inclusive
community, but we’re also looking for the mad scientist in each of you.

I hope that this has given you a good idea of what to expect when signing up
for CSH. It’s a crazy ride for sure, but it’s totally worth it. If anything,
I hope I’ve talked you _into_ applying. I look forward to meeting you all when
school starts!
