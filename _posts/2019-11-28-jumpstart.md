# What is Jumpstart?
Jumpstart dashboard that runs on a TV in the CSH 'Vader lobby'. Its primary goal is to display 
relevant information to members of CSH to jumpstart their days.

# Features
 - Displays the date & time
 - CSH Logo that changes colors based on time of day. The logo can also changes for holidays
 like christmas
 - A spot for announcements. eboard members can choose to display messages posted in 
 #announcements on Jumpstart. This was done through a custom slack app that utilizes various Slack
 APIs.
 - A module that displays a different random title from r/showerthoughts every 30 seconds.
 - A module that displays real-time status information from CSH's server room.

 events from the CSH calendar.

# What I learned through Jumpstart
 Through working on Jumpstart I learned how to make an app using the flask framework. I also learned how to use fetch in javascript along with how to make a slack bot using the Slack API. In addition
 to that, I learned how to work with the Google calendar API and a whole bunch of other cool stuff.
