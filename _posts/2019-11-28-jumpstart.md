# What is Jumpstart?
Jumpstart is a dashboard that runs on a TV in the CSH Elevator Lobby. Its primary goal is to display 
relevant information to members of CSH to jumpstart their days.
â€‹
# Features
 - Displays the date & time
 - CSH Logo that changes colors based on time of day. The logo can also change for holidays
 - A spot for announcements, which Eboard members can make through our Slack. This is done using a custom slack app that utilizes Slack's APIs.
 - A module that displays a random title from r/showerthoughts every 30 seconds.
 - A module that displays real-time status information from CSH's server room.
 - A calendar module that uses the Google calendar API to display a contdown to the next 10
 events from the CSH calendar.
 - A module that displays a daily forecast.
 - A module that shows the name of the file that [Harold](https://csh.rit.edu/about/projects.html) is playing.
 
# What I learned through Jumpstart
 Through working on Jumpstart, I learned how to make an app using the Flask framework. I also learned how to use fetch in JavaScript along with how to make a slack bot using the Slack API. In addition
 to that, I learned how to work with the Google calendar API and a whole bunch of other cool stuff.
