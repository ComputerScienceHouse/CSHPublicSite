 		<p style="padding-left: 5px">Starting around dusk we'll be playing Capture the Disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the name suggests, Capture the Disk is a game similar to Capture the Flag, but with a CSH spin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules will be explained prior to the start of the game.</p>
                <h4 class="event-name">Plates</h4>
 		<p style="padding-left: 5px">
 			After Capture the Disk is finished it's time to get plates!  Small groups will organize and go to various restaurants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you like Mark's, Nick Tahou's, Steve T, or another place entirely this is the time to undo any kind of remotely healthy exercise Capture the Disk provided.
