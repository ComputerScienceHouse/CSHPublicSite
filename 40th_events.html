                <h4 class="event-name">Capture the Disk</h4>
 		<p style="padding-left: 5px">Starting around dusk we'll be playing Capture the Disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the name suggests, Capture the Disk is a game similar to Capture the Flag, but with a CSH spin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules will be explained prior to the start of the game. There will be an info session to teach new players and help old players learn the rule changes that have occurred over the years. The session will be at 7pm in NRH 1250.</p>
                <h4 class="event-name">Plates</h4>
 		<p style="padding-left: 5px">
 			After Capture the Disk is finished it's time to get plates!  Small groups will organize and go to various restaurants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you like Mark's, Nick Tahou's, Steve T, or another place entirely this is the time to undo any kind of remotely healthy exercise Capture the Disk provided.

                <h4 class="event-name">Messed Up Movie Night (FUMN)</h4>
 		<p style="padding-left: 5px">
 			Messed Up Movie Night (FUMN) is a gathering of like minded individuals looking for some good, ol' fashioned depraved, disturbing, or sometimes just plain awful, film. A few times a year The Committee descends upon house to screen approximately 10 hours of both feature and short films in one sitting. Some attendees have a skewed view of what the words "Messed Up" means... Messed Up is somewhat subjective... This subjectivity is best illustrated by the diversity of the list below as well as the reactions of the attendees themselves... Often arguments will break out after a particular film is screened between those who thought the film was Messed Up and those who think The Committee has lost it's mind.
