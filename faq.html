                <h4>Is CSH a Fraternity?</h4>
                <p>No, Computer Science House is not a Fraternity, nor is it involved or affiliated with Greek Life. CSH is a special interest house (SIH), which means we are an organization that is oriented towards some hobby or interest, in our case computers. </p>

                <h4>What is the Introductory Process like?</h4>
                <p>There are a few components to the introductory process, which are all designed to help you get to know your fellow intro members and the upperclassmen. All of these requirements can be found in our <a href="https://constitution.csh.rit.edu/bylaws.pdf" style="color:#8E0E67">Constitution</a> in section 4</p>

                                <p>When you submit your application through the housing contract, there is a section for <em>Special Interest Housing</em> which has an application for CSH. Later on, you may be notified to schedule an interview over the phone (or Skype). You can then either be accepted as an on-floor or off-floor member.</p>

                                <p>You can come to floor at anytime, we are located in the third floor of Nathaniel Rochester Hall. You can also email the <a href="mailto:evals@csh.rit.edu" style="color:#8E0E67">Evaluations Director</a> to get an application. When you fill out the application, you can then get an informal interview on floor.</p>

                        <h5>The Intro Packet</h5>
                        <p>The Packet a website that allows you to get "signatures" from the other members after talking to them. It is designed for the new intro members to get to know their fellow freshmen and upper classmen by introducing themselves and just talking with each other. Some upperclassmen will give "learning quests" in order to get their signature, these can vary from "Write a 'Hello World' program in a language that you don't already know," or just "Make a GitHub account."</p>

                        <h5>The Freshmen Project</h5>
                        <p>The Freshman Project is an annual fundraising event run by the Intro members to benefit a charity of their choice. Previous years have done events ranging from A 5k race(2014), game tournament(2016), or a carnival(2017). The Project helps the intro members to bond together.</p>

                <h4>What happens if I am not accepted</h4>
                <p>If you are not accepted when you apply over the summer, you can always reapply when you arrive at RIT. You will have a better chance of getting in since we don't have to adhere to the 50 person on-floor limit.</p>
