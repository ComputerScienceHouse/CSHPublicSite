        <p>Dear Computer Science House Member,</p>

               <p> I’m excited to invite you to Computer Science House’s 40th Anniversary weekend! There’s a lot to look forward to and a whole lot of planning that has gone into it so far and will continue to go into it until April 16th. We look forward to greeting you all back on floor and having a fun weekend re-connecting. We’ve arranged for a Hotel block at the Hampton Inn a short ten minute drive from RIT via a TBD link. (This is an expanding block so please book ASAP)</p>
               <p> We’ve planned a phenomenal looking weekend for everyone starting with a game of Capture the Disk the night of Friday April 15th for those who can make it in that early. After which will be trips to your garbage plate destination of choice. During the day Saturday we’ll hold tours of floor to show off our new facilities as well as behind the scenes tours of the new Gene Polisseni Center for all you hockey fans. Following all this will be a formal banquet held in the Davis Room of the Student Alumni Union at 7:00 PM Saturday. There will be a buffet of Italian food including Chicken Piccata, Tortellini, Salads, and a dessert of Tiramisu! There will be plenty of refreshments, a dance floor, and a brief speech from yours truly on the current state of Computer Science House! For those of you with small children who are looking for babysitting, we’re currently looking into renting a licensed child care facility for the night, if you’re interested in this please note this in your RSVP.</p>
                <p>Sunday morning we’ll have one last get together / good bye in the form of a brunch back at the Davis Room before everyone heads back to their respective homes. We’ll be distributing T-Shirts specially designed for this event!</p>
               <p> I look forward to seeing those of you I know and am excited to meet those I don’t! If you have any questions at all don’t hesitate to reach out to me at chairman@csh.rit.edu.</p>

Sincerely,<br>
Andrew Glaude<br>
Computer Science House Chairman
