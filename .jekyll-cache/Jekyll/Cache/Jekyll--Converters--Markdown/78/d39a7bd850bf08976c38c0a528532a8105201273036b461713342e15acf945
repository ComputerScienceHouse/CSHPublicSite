<p>CSH currently uses Proxmox for VM hosting. It has been working great for every use case we have for it with one exception: member VM self-service. The interface isn’t very intuitive to someone who might not have created a VM before, creating a higher barrier to entry than we would like for members who might want to start learning how to use Linux for the first time. It also lacked the ability to enforce resource limits and automatically cleanup VMs that members weren’t using anymore. All of my previous major projects were much more operations and/or security focused so I figured writing something to solve this problem would be a great way to do a much more development focused project and expand my developer skillset.</p>
