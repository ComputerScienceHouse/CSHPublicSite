<p>Through working on Jumpstart, I learned how to make an app using the Flask framework. I also learned how to use fetch in JavaScript along with how to make a slack bot using the Slack API. In addition
 to that, I learned how to work with the Google calendar API and a whole bunch of other cool stuff.</p>
