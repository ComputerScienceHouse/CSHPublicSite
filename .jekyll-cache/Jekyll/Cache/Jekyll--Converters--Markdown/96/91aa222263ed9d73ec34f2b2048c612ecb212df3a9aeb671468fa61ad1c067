I"å<p>Computers do math quite fast, but how fast? Well, the answer to that question changes quite significantly depending on 
the programming language being used.</p>

<p>To explore this relationship I implemented a common collision detection algorithm called <a href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/collision-detection-using-the-separating-axis-theorem--gamedev-169">separating axis theorem</a> 
in Python, Rust, and Kotlin. This algorithm uses linear algebra to check if two convex 2D polygons are overlapping. 
Since this is a linear algebra algorithm most of the work is repetitive arithmetic. This makes it a relatively good 
test of raw execution speed.</p>

<p>Even before running the code I can expect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> to be 
the slowest since itâ€™s the only interpreted language being tested. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a>, 
on the other hand, is compiled down to machine code so it should be significantly faster. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)">Kotlin</a> 
should be somewhere in the middle since itâ€™s compiled but runs in the Java Virtual Machine instead of directly on the 
hardware.</p>

<p>The metric Iâ€™ll be measuring here is the wall-clock execution time. Note that this approach has an inherent amount of 
inaccuracy due to how operating systems handle process scheduling. However, itâ€™s also the metric thatâ€™s most immediately 
understandable and comparable so it works well for this situation.</p>

<p>The actual program that Iâ€™m using takes two objects and sets their center points 100 pixels away from each other. Then 
one object is moved towards the other in steps of 1 pixel at a time until the algorithm detects collision. This process 
is then repeated 10,000 times in order to build up a sufficiently long execution time to get an accurate comparision.</p>

<p>Here are the results from running this test. Note how Kotlin and Rust have fairly similar results even though Kotlin 
runs in the JVM.</p>

<p>Now this is a pretty naive implementation. The two objects are 10 and 1 pixels across respectively so it takes a lot of 
iterations before they collide. This algorithm takes the most time to run when the objects arenâ€™t touching so it would 
be quite helpful if there was a way to skip over at least some of the iterations where they arenâ€™t touching.</p>

<p>It turns out that itâ€™s trivial to calculate a rough estimate of the distance between the two objects by taking one point 
from each and applying the Pythagorean theorem. Now, this would be a very rough estimate since it doesnâ€™t take into 
account the rotation or shape of the objects in question. However, if that rough separation estimate is greater than the 
combined width of the two objects at their widest points then it can be assumed that the objects arenâ€™t touching. In 
all other cases the program would still have to run the collision detection algorithm as before to get an accurate 
result.</p>

<p>With this optimization in play the execution times drop significantly. Note that due to the the inherent inaccuracy of 
the timing method used, the results for Rust on the two computers should be interpreted as roughly equal.</p>

<p>Even though Python is quite slow in comparison to Kotlin and Rust, it turns out that itâ€™s still easily fast enough to 
do this math in real time for a game. In fact the very Python code I tested here is used in game server of my <a href="https://github.com/JoelEager/pyTanks.Server">pyTanks</a> 
project to check for collisions between the game objects. This just goes to show the trade off that exists with 
interpreted languages. While they may be more convenient to work with youâ€™re paying the price for that convenience in 
the execution speed.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re interested in playing with these programs yourself you can find the Rust version <a href="https://github.com/JoelEager/Rust-Collision-Detector">here</a> 
and the Kotlin version <a href="https://github.com/JoelEager/Kotlin-Collision-Detector">here</a>. The Python code is part of the 
server portion of my pyTanks project <a href="https://github.com/JoelEager/pyTanks.Server">here</a>. Specifically, the Python 
script that implements the algorithm is located <a href="https://github.com/JoelEager/pyTanks.Server/blob/master/gameLogic/collisionDetector.py">here</a> 
in that repository. All of these repositories are under the MIT licence so if youâ€™d like to make use of this code in one 
of your own projects youâ€™re more than welcome to.</p>
