<p><a href="https://github.com/zcy3071/CapsuleKiller">Capsule Killer</a> is a first-person shooter that I developed to learn more about the skills and 
processes involved with game development. Upon launching the game, the player will be met with a main menu that allows them to start a game, 
view the controls, or exit the game. When a player starts a game, they will spawn in the center of the map and enemies will begin spawning 
at random locations throughout the map every 2-5 seconds. The enemies move towards the player, doing damage upon collision with the player. 
The player has the ability to run away from and shoot enemies. The goal of the game is to defeat as many enemies as possible.</p>
