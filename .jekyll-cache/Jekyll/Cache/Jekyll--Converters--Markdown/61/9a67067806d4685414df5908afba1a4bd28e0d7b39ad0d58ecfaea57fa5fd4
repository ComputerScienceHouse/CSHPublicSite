<p>This program, ClÄdÄ“s Cimicum, (which means â€˜Bane of Bugsâ€™ in Latin) is a very small and simple debugger for interprocess debugging. This is slightly different from that of GDB, since GDB actually creates a child process when debugging. CladÄ“s Cimicum can read the memory of any running process, without having to be run in some special environment beforehand.</p>
