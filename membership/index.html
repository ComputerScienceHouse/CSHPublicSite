                    You don't need to be majoring in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or even anything related. Maybe you're a business major, or perhaps an art student; all we expect is that you have an interest in computers, a willingness to be active on floor, and a desire to excel in all aspects of your life.

                    Even before college, a great way to meet members and learn about CSH is to take a tour during RIT's open houses. On those days, members lead personalized tours of floor, highlighting our unique facilities, exemplary projects, and social atmosphere. For open house dates, visit the RIT admissions web site. If you are unable to attend an open house, email our Evaluations Director to schedule a time that is best for you. After being accepted to RIT, look for the Special Interest Housing selection in your RIT housing application to apply to CSH.

                    Students already enrolled at RIT can apply to join CSH at any time. The best way to apply is to visit CSH (on the third floor of Nathaniel Rochester Hall) and pick up an application from our Evaluations Director. All majors and years are accepted and members can live on or off floor.
