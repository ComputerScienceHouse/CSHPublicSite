          CSH isn’t just about working on projects. Our members love to engage
          in a variety of social activities. Many of these activities have
          persisted through the years to become traditions.

        <p class="long-form">
          Every year, CSH goes out on an adventure to see if we can survive for
          a weekend in the wild. Surprisingly, a bunch of computer nerds can
          thrive without electricity for a few days.

          Every year, the introductory members of CSH plan and host a charity
          event. The events range from simple bake sales to video game
          tournaments and are always a blast to put on.

          Holiday Dinner is our annual formal dinner that takes place right
          before Winter Break. All of CSH gets dressed up and has dinner at a
          classy restaurant. This is immediately followed by another traditional
          event, Secret Santa.

          We participate in most of the intramural sports RIT offers, including
          hockey, soccer, basketball, softball, dodgeball, and volleyball. While
          we aren’t always the best team out there, we’re always the
          best-looking (with our CSH jerseys) and have the most fans cheering us
          on! We’ve even won quite an impressive number of trophies in the past,
          which are proudly displayed in our library.

          Any member can hold a seminar to teach others a bit about a topic of
          their choosing. Subjects can range from programming to juggling and
          everything in between, and anyone can give one at any time.

          Welcome Back is a barbecue held at the beginning of each year to
          welcome the incoming freshman class. Traditionally, alumni come from
          far and wide to visit current floor members. We cook way too much
          food, tell stories, and participate in a variety of outdoor
          activities.
