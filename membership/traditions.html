                    CSH isn’t just about working on projects. Our members love to engage
                    in a variety of social activities. Many of these activities have
                    persisted through the years to become traditions.

                    Welcome Back is a barbecue held at the beginning of each year to
                    welcome the incoming freshman class. Traditionally, alumni come from
                    far and wide to visit current floor members. We cook way too much
                    food, tell stories, and participate in a variety of outdoor
                    activities.

                    Every year, CSH goes out on an adventure to see if we can survive for
                    a weekend in the wild. Surprisingly, a bunch of computer nerds can
                    thrive without electricity for a few days.

              Every year, the introductory members of CSH plan and host a charity
              event. The events range from simple bake sales to video game
              tournaments and are always a blast to put on.

                    Holiday Dinner is our annual formal dinner that takes place right
                    before Winter Break. All of CSH gets dressed up and has dinner at a
                    classy restaurant. This is immediately followed by another traditional
                    event, Secret Santa.

                    Any member can hold a seminar to teach others a bit about a topic of
                    their choosing. Subjects can range from programming to juggling and
                    everything in between, and anyone can give one at any time.

                    We participate in most of the intramural sports RIT offers, including
                    broomball, hockey, soccer, basketball, softball, dodgeball, and volleyball. While
                    we aren’t always the best team out there, we’re always the
                    best-looking (with our CSH jerseys) and have the most fans cheering us
                    on! We’ve even won quite an impressive number of trophies in the past,
                    which are proudly displayed in our library.
