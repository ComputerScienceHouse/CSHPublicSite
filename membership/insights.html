                    Insights is a promotional program where prospective students have the option to spend a weekend at Computer Science House. As the name would suggest, Insights gives students a real, first-hand experience of campus life the likes of which no tour guide can convey. Students will spend a weekend hosted by members of CSH, a Special Interest Floor dedicated to students interested in computing. They will have to opportunity to participate in learning workshops hosted by house members, join in on CSH traditions like Capture the Disk, and much more.
