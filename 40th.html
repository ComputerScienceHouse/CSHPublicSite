			    	<h3>Capture the Disk</h3>
					<p>Starting around dusk we'll be playing Capture the Disk. Like the name suggests, Capture the Disk is a game similar to Capture the Flag, but with a CSH spin. Rules will be explained prior to the start of the game.</p>
					<h3>Plates</h3>
					<p>After Capture the Disk is finished it's time to get plates! Small groups will organize and go to various restaurants. Whether you like Mark's, Nick Tahou's, Steve T, or another place entirely this is the time to undo any kind of remotely healthy exercise Capture the Disk provided.</p>

			    	<h3>Tours of Gene Polisseni Center</h3>

					<h3>Tour Floor</h3>
