                        The primary responsibility of the History director is keeping the line of communication between CSH and our alumni open. We believe members should have a well-developed understanding of House's origins and accomplishments. History keeps the past alive through the yearbook, Coredump newsletter, floor displays, archiving, updating the media database, and managing alumni relations. History also coordinates alumni storytelling nights and other traditional events.
