                        Drink and Snack are two of CSH's oldest projects. Networked vending machines allow members to order items from any internet browser using a credits system. A timer can also be specified to delay the release of a purchased item.

                    <p>
                        One Project Per Freshman looks to put the necessary tools in the hands of freshman to enable them to learn more about hardware electronics projects without a financial investment on their part. In its current form, incoming freshman members are given the choice between a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino with a starter kit to tinker with throughout the year.

                        <a href="http://schedule.csh.rit.edu/" style="color:#8E0E67">Schedule Maker</a> allows RIT students to plan their schedule for upcoming semesters. Users simply enter their course numbers and custom events and a list of all schedules that match their parameters will be shown. Because it is so easy and simple, Schedule Maker is now used by over 90% of RIT students.

                    <p>
                        Two CSH members built this arcade cabinet from scratch. It emulates many classic arcade games from varying consoles and supports multiplayer. A second cabinet featuring a custom-made platforming game was also built. Both machines, along with other arcade cabinets CSH has acquired, are housed in our Library.
