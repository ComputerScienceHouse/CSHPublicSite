			Projects are an integral part of the living, learning experience at Computer Science House. This is a small sample of our notable projects that our members have created:

					<h2>Drink/Snack</h2>
					<p>
						Drink and snack are two of CSH's oldest projects. Networked vending machines allow members to order items from any internet browser using a credits system. A timer can also be specified to delay the release of a purchased item.

					<h2><a href="http://schedule.csh.rit.edu/" target="_blank">Schedule Maker</a></h2>
					<p>
						Schedule Maker allows RIT students to plan their schedule for upcoming semesters. Users simply enter their course numbers and custom events and a list of all schedules that match their parameters will be shown. Because it is so easy and simple, Schedule Maker is now used by over 90% of RIT students.

					<h2>CSH Arcade</h2>
					<p>
						Two CSH members built this arcade cabinet from scratch. It emulates many classic arcade games from varying consoles and supports multiplayer. A second cabinet featuring a cusom-made platforming game was also built. Both machines, along with other arcade cabinets CSH has acquired, are housed in our Library.

					<h2>Harold</h2>
					<p>
						With Harold, every member of CSH gets their own personal theme song. Audio clips can be uploaded and selected via a simple web interface and are played when a user touches their iButton (received upon membership) to an appropriate reader.
					</p>

					<h2>InfoSys</h2>

					<h2>Heroine</h2>
					<p>
						An ongoing companion project to Drink, Heroine is a robot that will retrieve purchased drink items and bring them to the room of any specified member. The robot has the ability to navigate obstacles and can always determine its location on floor.
