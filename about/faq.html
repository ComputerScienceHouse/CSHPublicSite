                        <h3>Does being a member cost anything?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our active membership dues are $80/semester.
                            Our operating budget is formed every year from dues paid by members in addition to sponsorships, and helps fund improvements to our floor, member projects, and social events!
                            Members unable to afford their dues can speak to our Financial Director and have their dues waived or adjusted.

                        <h3>Is CSH a fraternity?</h3>
                        <p>
                            No, we're a Special Interest House: a space in RIT's dorms designed for students who share common interests to live together.
