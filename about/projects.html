        <p class="long-form">
          Drink and Snack are two of CSH's oldest projects. Networked vending
          machines allow members to order items from any internet browser using
          a credits system. A timer can also be specified to delay the release
          of a purchased item.

        <p class="long-form">
          Schedule Maker allows RIT students to plan their schedule for upcoming
          semesters. Users simply enter their course numbers and custom events
          and a list of all schedules that match their parameters will be shown.
          Because it is so easy and simple, Schedule Maker is now used by over
          90% of RIT students.

        <p class="long-form">
          One Project Per Freshman looks to put the necessary tools in the hands
          of freshman to enable them to learn more about hardware electronics
          projects without a financial investment on their part. In its current
          form, incoming freshman members are given the choice between a
          Raspberry Pi or an Arduino with a starter kit to tinker with
          throughout the year.

          With Harold, every member of CSH gets his or her own theme song. After
          a user uploads either their song or playlist to a web app, all they
          have to do is touch their iButton or RFID tag (received upon
          membership) to the appropriate reader.

        <p class="long-form">
          Two CSH members built this arcade cabinet from scratch. It emulates
          many classic arcade games from varying consoles and supports
          multiplayer. A second cabinet featuring a custom-made platforming game
          was also built. Both machines, along with other arcade cabinets CSH
          has acquired, are housed in our Library.
